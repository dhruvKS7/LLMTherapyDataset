So it’ s like the filter how you determine what you’re going to focus on and what you’re going to let go, is misdirected. Because the size of your pores – that’ s a small detail and it doesn’ t actually have much consequence on your life if we look at it objectively . However , when you choose to focus on it it can become something that ends up having a big impact on your life because it becomes really upsetting for you. Whereas something like losing your school ID has a pretty big impact – it makes your life so much less convenient.\" patient: \"Yes, it does .\" ', 'therapist_result': 'And I’m not judging what you’re paying attention to. It certainly is – it’ s just that if we think about it from my favorite perspective of what’ s adaptive, what’ s working for you and what’ s working against you – filtering important detail to focus on and detail that I can just let slip by , it’s going to really be helpful to you because if we choose to focus on the details that are adaptive – what’ s going to work for you and let go of things that are going to work against you, I think you’ll find that things are a lot smoother . So like the credit card date. It’s a detail that if you can schedule your bank to pay your credit card automatically two days before the closing date it’ s going to be really efficient for you and will work for you rather than work against you. And things that don’t actually harm you – just like with  thinking about what’ s gross but not harmful. Same thing with little blemishes or pores – they’re not really going to harm you. You may not like it when things aren’ t as smooth as can be but it’ s not going to harm you so it’ s something that you can kind of let go.', 'base_result': \"Okay, so you agree that you sometimes focus on smaller, less impactful things while overlooking larger, more significant issues.  That makes sense.  Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you get caught up in those smaller details?  What's going through your mind?\\n\", 'finetuned_result': 'So if we look at it through that lens the same thing happens with the writing process. Writing a thesis is not an objectively small detail and yet you kind of say it doesn’ t have that much impact. It’ s more of a big deal. And I guess it’s more of a big deal because you can get very anxious about it if you think about it. But in some ways, the writing of a thesis is not a big detail. In fact, it’ s huge in the grand scheme of your life. So there’ s some strange disconnect there. The same thing happens with student loans. They’re not a small objective detail. Student loans are a massive objective detail. But I think because you don’ t really like to think about them or plan for them they kind of become more manageable and stress-inducing when you’re in the midst of them.'},\n",
